### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am  

1) a retired software developer + analyst
  * schooled on IBM mainframes (Fortran, PLI, Assembler) in the 70's, with 
    exposure to unix and Windows systems (C, VB) in the 90's
  * structured programming + top down design + structured analysis were the basic principles
    that I followed then
    
2) a retired musician 
  * having played in cover bands during my teens and early 20s as a bass player + backup singer

I am currently developing a .Net (VB, C, C#) Windows desk top application in my spare time called 
GuitarAmigo, which allows musicians to jam and collaborate over the internet.
